Since there are no skin components here, the skins layer has been disabled in the profile.

If you want to place skins components here:
 - visit profiles/default/skins.xml and uncomment the contents of the document
 - in __init__.py, uncomment the registerDirectory lines
 - place your components,
 - remove this file,
 - restart,
 - and do a quickinstaller reinstall (or profile step application).
